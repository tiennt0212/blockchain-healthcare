# Data layer or we should call back-end layer

In the first thought, I think I will create a layer name service for handling any back-end connection.
I, then, changed to idea that we will implement these data fetch/update in the model. I should thank to
the rematch. This reduces the boilerplate of the code.

Here, I implement a demonstration on the user-page.
